\subsection{The reaction}
\begin{chemequation}
\ce{C + H2 -> ^3CH2}
\end{chemequation}
These reactions are typically modeled by Lindemann falloff,
the kinetics model is the same as the bimolecular reactions
(section~\ref{Titan_bimol_sec}), we obtain thus as rate constant:
\begin{equation}
k(T,\concAtm) = \frac{\concAtm \alpha_0(T) \alpha_\infty(T)}{\alpha_\infty(T) + \concAtm \alpha_0(T)}
\end{equation}
This type of reaction depends on the pressure (\concAtm),
$\alpha_0(T)$ is the kinetics model used at low pressure,
$\alpha_\infty(T)$ at high pressures.
