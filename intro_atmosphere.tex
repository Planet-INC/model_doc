An atmospheric molecule, and by extension, an atmosphere, is characterized by
its scale height, i.e. the distance over which the density is divided by $e$, and
its mean free path, i.e. the mean length a molecule can cover before undergoing
a collision.

\begin{equation}
\sch(z) = \frac{\kb T(z)}{\gloc(z)\mass}
\label{scale_height}
\end{equation}
with \kb\ the Boltzmann constant, 
\mass\ the molecule mass ($\mass = \frac{\Mm}{\Nav}$, with
\Mm\ the molar mass and \Nav\ the Avogadro number), 
$\gloc(z)$ the gravitationnal field at altitude $z$, given by the equation
\begin{equation}
\gloc(z) = \frac{\Guni\cdot\MPlanet}{\left(\RPlanet + z\right)^2}
\label{gfield}
\end{equation}

The mean free path is a collision process. Thus the molecule is approximated
by a hard sphere (rigid molecule model), and its hard sphere radius enables
to model a collision cross-section between two molecules $i$ and $j$:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{(ij)}_\text{col} = \pi\left(r_i + r_j\right)^2
\label{sigma_collision}
\end{equation}
The mean free path of species $s$ is then expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\mfp_s = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\conc_i\sigma^{(si)}_\text{col}\sqrt{1 + \frac{\mass_s}{\mass_i}}}
\label{mean_free_path}
\end{equation}
The exobase is the altitude at wich the mean free path is equal to the scale height. At this
altitude, collisions can be neglected.
